*Easily Adjust Date & Time in Standalone Window Managers*

![Image of dateTimeSetter](https://aedrielkylejavier.me/scripts-and-tools/img/dateTimeSetter-tk.png)

## Rationale

I use a standalone Window Manager on Linux (no Desktop Environment) and I missed having a simple GUI to quickly change Timezones and toggle NTP in a settings panel, which is commonly found in Desktop Environments. To address this, I made `dateTimeSetter`, a simple "date & time setter" written in Python and Tk.

## Features

* Simple as possible, so that it just gets out of your way and you can proceed with your life.
* Can manipulate the following through the interface:
    * Date
    * Time
    * Timezone
    * Local RTC setting
    * NTP
* Automatically sets the Date, Time, and Timezone with a checkbox.
* `Makefile` 
    * I've also included a Makefile that utilizes `cython3` to create a `.c` file from the `.py` code and then compile with `gcc` into a single binary.
    * I can't really vouch for the continued reliability of the `Makefile` nor can I promise a significant performance increase with it being compiled as C code, but it's there if you want to give it a go üòå. 
    * You will need to have `cython`, `gcc`, and `make` installed on your system (on top of the dependencies listed below) to utilize the `Makefile`.


## Dependencies

To use `dateTimeSetter`, you will need to install the following dependencies. Here are some instructions on how to install them on various Linux distributions:

### Ubuntu / Debian
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pip
pip3 install pytz requests
```

### Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter python3-pip
pip3 install pytz requests
```

### Arch Linux
```sh
sudo pacman -S tk python-pip python-pytz python-requests
```

## Usage

```sh
$ python3 ./dateTimeSetter.py
```

or simply‚Ä¶

```sh
$ ./dateTimeSetter.py
```

### How I Like to Run it On My Machines

As seen on my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/kj-sh604/dotfiles), I wrap the usage of `dateTimeSetter` in a script:

*I have it named as* `dateTime` *on my system*

```sh
#!/bin/sh

BIN_PATH=~/.local/share/python-dateTimeSetter/dateTime
SCRIPT_PATH=~/.local/share/python-dateTimeSetter/dateTime.py

if [ -f "$BIN_PATH" ]; then
    if command -v lxsudo > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        lxsudo $BIN_PATH
    elif command -v gksudo > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        gksudo $BIN_PATH
    elif command -v pkexec > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        pkexec env DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" XAUTHORITY="$XAUTHORITY" $BIN_PATH
    else
        echo "No suitable graphical authentication tool found. Running without root privileges."
        notify-send "No suitable graphical authentication tool found. Running without root privileges."
        $BIN_PATH
    fi
elif [ -f "$SCRIPT_PATH" ]; then
    if command -v lxsudo > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        lxsudo python3 $SCRIPT_PATH
    elif command -v gksudo > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        gksudo python3 $SCRIPT_PATH
    elif command -v pkexec > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        pkexec env DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" XAUTHORITY="$XAUTHORITY" python3 $SCRIPT_PATH
    else
        echo "No suitable graphical authentication tool found. Running without root privileges."
        notify-send "No suitable graphical authentication tool found. Running without root privileges."
        python3 $SCRIPT_PATH
    fi
else
    echo "dateTime/dateTime.py not found"
    notify-send "Error!" "dateTime/dateTime.py not found" --urgency critical
fi
```

Feel free to implement something similar.
